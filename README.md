# School_District_Analysis
## 1.Overview of the school district analysis

  The purpose of our analysis is to find the overall passing percentages of the students and see if there is any correlation with the budget per student. What we have found is that some of the test scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High School are missing. Since these values are missing we want to take all of the scores from the high school so that it doesn't affect our overall numbers.


## 2.Results

  The over all passing for Thomas High School was 90.94% before the district, with the 9th graders taken out the overall passing shrinks by 0.3 %. And the Over all passing for all High School was 65.17%, after the district, it droped 64.86%, which is less than 1%.

  In the original analysis, Thomas High School started with a 91% overall passing rate, which was a concern to the school board as being too high. After calculating the total number of 10th - 12th grade students as the new denominator, the rest of the testing data was adjusted accordingly.Removing the 9th grade students from the data set had a huge impact by dropping from 91% to 65% for the overall passing rate.
